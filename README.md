# Wind-Turbine-Analytics-Dashboard

Key Features:



1. Interactive Data Tables: The dashboard leverages Panel to present data on wind turbines that users can interact with through sorting, filtering, and pagination. This functionality is essential for drilling down into the data based on specific criteria such as the state where the turbines are located, the manufacturer, or the year they were installed. It offers a user-friendly way to explore detailed subsets of data and derive insights tailored to particular interests or needs.

2. Dynamic Visualizations: Employing hvplot and Holoviews, the dashboard provides dynamic visualizations like bar charts and scatter plots. These visualizations are responsive and update according to user interactions. They are particularly useful for visualizing the distribution of turbine capacities and the frequency of different manufacturers, providing clear statistical insights that aid in understanding larger trends within the data.

3. Data Filtering and Grouping: To enhance user interaction and analytical depth, the dashboard includes features like interactive sliders and radio buttons. These tools allow users to filter and aggregate the dataset according to chosen parameters, making it easier to analyze specific aspects of the data and spot trends or anomalies.

4. Technology Stack:
   - Python: The backbone for backend scripting, data manipulation, and server-side logic, ensuring robust processing and functionality.
   - Panel: This framework is crucial for constructing the web-based dashboard, managing its layout, and facilitating interactivity.
   - hvPlot and Holoviews: These libraries are instrumental in generating interactive plots directly from pandas data structures, enabling real-time data visualization.
   - Intake: Simplifies the management of data catalogs and loading, making data access straightforward and efficient.
   - Pandas and Numpy: These tools are foundational for data analysis and manipulation, supporting complex computations and data transformation within the dashboard.
