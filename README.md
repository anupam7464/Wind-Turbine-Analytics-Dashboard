# Wind-Turbine-Analytics-Dashboard

The main goal of this dashboard is to provide stakeholders, including engineers, energy analysts, and policy makers, with an intuitive and interactive tool for visualizing, querying, and analyzing data related to wind turbines. This includes information on turbine locations, capacities, manufacturers, installation years, and other relevant attributes.

Key Features:
1.Interactive Data Tables: Utilizing `panel`'s Tabulator widget, the dashboard displays wind turbine data that can be sorted, filtered, and paginated interactively. This allows users to explore specific subsets of data based on criteria like state, manufacturer, or year of installation.

2. Dynamic Visualizations: With `hvplot` and `holoviews`, the dashboard offers dynamic visualizations such as bar charts or scatter plots that update based on user interactions. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and aggregation of turbine capacities, frequencies of manufacturers, and other statistical insights.

3. Data Filtering and Grouping: Interactive widgets like sliders and radio buttons allow users to filter the dataset and aggregate data based on selected parameters, enhancing the analytical capabilities of the dashboard.

4. Geographic Data Handling: For datasets with geographic information (longitude and latitude), there is potential functionality (commented out in the provided script) to convert these into a more visualization-friendly format, preparing the data for mapping if needed.

5. Technology Stack:
    - Python: Used for backend scripting, data manipulation, and server-side logic.
    - Panel: Serves as the framework for building the web-based dashboard, handling the layout and interactivity.
    - hvPlot and Holoviews: Used for creating interactive plots directly from pandas data structures.
    - Intake: Manages data catalogs and loading, simplifying access to datasets.
    - Pandas and Numpy: Provide tools for data analysis and manipulation.
